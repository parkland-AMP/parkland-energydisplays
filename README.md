# Parkland College Energy Displays

## website
This folder contains the full website (HTML, CSS, JS, etc...) that displays on the monitors. It is currently deployed to internal servers at Parkland. 

## brightauthor
This folder contains the *.bpf files (the BrightAuthor project files) for the X & L and D wing displays. It is pretty basic in the fact that it contains a layout that just points to the website starter page.
